/**
 * In an imaginary country called Lisarb, all the people are very happy to pay their taxes 
 * because they know that doesnâ€™t exist corrupt politicians and the taxes are used to benefit the 
 * population, without any misappropriation. The currency of this country is Rombus, whose symbol is R$.

Read a value with 2 digits after the decimal point, equivalent to the salary of a Lisarb inhabitant. 
Then print the due value that this person must pay of taxes, according to the table below.

| Salary | Taxes
| from 0  2000.00 | Exempt
| from 2000.01 to 3000.00 | 8%
| from 3000.01 to 4500.00 | 18%
| more than 4,500.00 | 28%

Remember, if the salary is R$ 3,002.00 for example, the rate of 8% is only over R$ 1,000.00, 
because the salary from R$ 0.00 to R$ 2,000.00 is tax free. In the follow example, 
the total rate is 8% over R$ 1000.00 + 18% over R$ 2.00, resulting in R$ 80.36 at all.
 The answer must be printed with 2 digits after the decimal point.

Input
The input contains only a float-point number, with 2 digits after the decimal point.

Output
Print the message "R$" followed by a blank space and the total tax to be payed, 
with two digits after the decimal point. If the value is up to 2000, print the message "Isento".
